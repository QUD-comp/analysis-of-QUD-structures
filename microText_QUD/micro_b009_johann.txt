What is the way things are?
>Is it fair of landlords to raise the rent when a new tenant moves in?
>>It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents.
>>Could an increase in the rent be justified?
>>>Clearly the landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease.
>>>So could the rent be raised strongly when a new tenant moves in?
>>>>But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease.
>>>>All the more so as for an adequate profit the rental rate as compared to the base rent need not be raised for every new lease.
