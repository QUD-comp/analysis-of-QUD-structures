>What about rent prices?
>>Are rent prices regulated?
>>>Rent prices are already regulated in favour of tenants
>>>Why are rent prices regulated?
>>>>due to existing laws and the rent index.
>>What about flats with rent contracts?
>>>In view of the high prices for buying flats with existing rent contracts,
>>>these are an unattractive investment.
>>>Should the owners of flats therefore be allowed to adjust rent prices?
>>>>Even if one might think that additional rent control is needed besides the current tenant protection,
>>>>one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level.
>>>>What is the conclusion from this regarding rent prices?
>>>>>A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported.
